I like my prompt to look something along the lines of this:

```
{directory}   > ...
```
and if there's an error:

```
{directory} STS ...
```

with STS for status code, and colors depending on mood. It's uniform yet errors can still be spotted easily when scrolling, and it's quite minimal.

In my shells I'm fond of running Fish in MSYS2/UCRT64, or a Linux VM (Ubuntu or Debian) and even the default prompt takes a noticeable delay to print.

This attempts to replace the shell interpreted version and be as performant as possible.
